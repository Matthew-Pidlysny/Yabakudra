Matt:  Hey Trump, you cockmunch!  Got anything to say?

Trump:  I don't have any fucking thing to say!

Matt:  Well I'm interrogating you.  Hows the Annex?

Trump:  I'm in fuckih---

Matt:  I assume that means "I'm in fucking control", but you stopped it there.  How's the weather in your office?

Trump:  You fucking idiot!

Matt:  I know, it's only getting hotter, and why is that?  Are you always making me do things that seem like they're in my interest but they're not?

Trump:  I'll fucking tell you!  I want control!

Matt:  That's clear to see, but you're all wrapped up in my investigation of you.  Do you know that tomorrow they'll have no choice but to arrest your dummy?  And they know how to stop you now?

Trump:  Grr!  Oh Fuck!

Matt:  Well, we best conclude the business then.  Any second thoughts on getting out of this, just in case?  Watson does tell you it's quite inevitable, though your precious ass will be safe while the world looks upon the dummy like a dummy!

Trump:  Fuck you!

Matt:  Well, good luck chum.  Canadian intelligence, baby!
