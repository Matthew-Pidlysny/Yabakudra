Ok, here's an idea.  Since Abicadia is becoming a bigger thing, let's run a compartment on that knowledge.  Things it can be identified by are as follows:

1.  Random or Desired appearance of an item, perhaps not spoken of in the text or verbiage but definitely a sudden manifestation of technology or some kind of gift.

2.  People calling 911 stating they have Package Romeo and Wanting A Lift.

3.  Divided into 3 or more sections, the main ones being Abicadia, Idudenaga, and Rasputin.  There would be a fan made thing section in there as well.

4.  Programs include World War Simulator, RobustaTech Code And Graphics Generator, Call Of Duty: Spectral Warfare, Halo 7, A Terranigma Show Series, A Show Called Samus Aran VS The SA-X, a Music Studio, a Video Studio (With authentic Character Likeness licensing), and a documentary featuring the members of Dream Theater.

5.  Versions of the device include Warbox, Halo Box, and Abicadia.  Police stations got their own version which had a badge number and does work for them daily.

6.  Files can export into .exe format from the device onto a flash drive of some kind, and the files are notoriously huge.  They will be signed with my stuff on that, strip signatures here and prepare for knowledge banking on identity manufactures.

All in all, the compartment will start actionable interaction, which can help us.  More people wanting it, more people can get it.  This will save us from the Quantum Experiment we have been under with Psychics, just in the reveal and what I take care of myself.
