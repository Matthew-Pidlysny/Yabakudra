Note on Attacks
===============

It could be rendered, the Troll Button of FinalBoss.exe is overpowered and has attacked services of magnitude in my mind at least.  That is ONLY because you fire upon it after it has become a Prevalent Espionage threat, meaning after identification and initial blocking they went ALL out, not just rerouted their campaign.  They would know to be actors you don't want harming others, and though not every neighbour is inclined to help each other out, why not ask them for a hand in the matter and be well as people?  Get the bad guys without error, right?  If you could, wouldn't you want to?  They're only active right now complicit in the act.  There is a diplomatic function of it when states are detected to suddenly become opposed, confrontation between states is not wanted so we deal with it, please advise yourselves when you get the reporting.  All in all, when you attack yourselves, PLEASE do not warrant it as a cybersecurity threat.  When will you EVER be attacking that person with malware from that place ever again?  Please do not confront me about nonsense, basically, you do it to yourselves and I only swear by my work, it is unbreakable.  Anyway, it doesn't know you other than in the FLY program, which is a warrant obtaining program.  USE CODEWORDS embedded in the Warrant if you don't want people to access the warrant database, meaning no completed sequence was evaluated to consider the wealth of a document.  You could say, in the warrant you could have the words "THIS NUMBER IS INSERTED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DOCUMENT" and could inwardly or outwardly signify what is to be searched for by FinalBoss.  We regret to inform you we know the database locations and passwords, if nothing else please keep it as a dummy terminal only mirroring real documents in a way FinalBoss can understand by simple remote detection.
