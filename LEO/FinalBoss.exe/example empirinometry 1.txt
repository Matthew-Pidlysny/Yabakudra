[Sigma]x-1(3452|&|^n)76-c=|&|^n+y

Whereas 

x is a graph co-ordinate, as we know always in flux with the graph in formation (Another "material" imposition, haha!)

n is the number of ampersands, as defined by Empironometry different in both equation and solution

c is the speed of light

y in the result of the entire equation, summed as the resulting y co-ordinate along with materially imposed & with it's quantity

And also that you previously thought mathematics was impossible to use to securely bitsign, whereas the function of an imposed value based on quantity in a dataset proves itself when applied in mechanical fashion.
