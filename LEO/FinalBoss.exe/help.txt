Would it be OK if YOU released the program?  You can all see it's the safest tool around, just do me a solid and find a way to get it done, I don't care as long as I see it.  Allah SWT really did put everything you needed in your hands, but I'll swear that I only see the threat outpacing the security until today, can you torrent it or something?  Hand it over to cybersecurity people?  Send it to Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, maybe?  They're loving Empirinometry from what I hear, they'd love to hear the program was able to be compiled from everything I said about the program (Need this, need that, therefore this).  Cheers!
