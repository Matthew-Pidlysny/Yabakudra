Hoof of Deer
Green Object (Naturally green)
Any food that follows the following criteria:

1.  Not potato like in ANY way you can stretch it to be.
2.  Grown inside the Earth, any mixture of that and untoasted bread to go along with it, if it's not a carrot.
3.  It must not be black in any way.
4.  Fire roast it's outside before eating, leaving the center raw.
5.  Roots will do fine so long as they are not the roots of Daucus Carota, no poisonous ones.

So, to describe, there are three elements AGREED upon in this.  Lucky for those who contrive the riddle, it DOES work.  So, let's discuss:

1.  The hoof will be ground so as to create prussian blue from that and blood.  The drawing of anything you choose will be yours to inherit as the lesson in this action.  Feel free to use what comes out of a common roast to do this, rather than draw your own blood or an innocent animals.

2.  Green objects are fun.  Use it in every way you can, from taking it on planes and thinking about it to throwing it, or cooking it if it can be safely.  Do anything to it over and over again until you're genuinely bored, and if you ever wonder if you're losing your momentum, just touch it for a while.

3.  Eat this well after roasting.  It is meant to bring out the lesson of the food, obtaining goodness from eating.  This will be the final component.

The raw lessons will apply with proper focus.  It's all I can do to simplify common things in ways that make wisdom apply.  The rest is in your learning in the world with these factors in mind.  Suffice to say, the green was a necessary trigger, it seems to be the most common of the types of triggers that are there for this wisdom to inherit.
