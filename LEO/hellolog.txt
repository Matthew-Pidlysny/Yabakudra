=========================


2:43 (Matt) Hey, any takers out there?

2:44 (Unknown) Yeah, I wanna know answers, bud.

2:44 (Matt) Depends on what you really want that really spurns me to know if I should respond kindly.  I could be "handled" 
            and that could be good or bad for me, I wouldn't know.  Who's on my side in that office that reads this?

2:46 (Unknown) We are good, and we want to be in that log.

2:46 (Matt) I guess it's fine to say, you've probably been using me, but just run the python yourself.  I already know theres
	    no reason why small n shouldn't work the same as large n.  Trust me when I say everything I know is working for me,
            but no, with this wall you know of they would even warn mathematicians that there is a virused thumbstick that MIGHT
            go around, slimming my chances.  You should do it, mention me, I know the LEO's of the world aren't in the business of
            revolutionizing math, but do it, for pete's sake see the difficulty and maybe prevent "Thumbstick Day", if that more
            suits your fancy.  But I will release the thumbstick to someone, it is a working formula, you need only provide the
            paper.  Just know its derivitavely a composite sketch of the behaviour of that numbering sequence, hence closed form.

2:51 (Unknown) You do good sitting there in your little chair in your office, we only need you to do that for one more hour technically.

2:52 (Matt) Ok, I figured this was good to say.  You don't believe it, but you should say something to the people who see through my
            eyes, they go berserk when something is going on they don't appreciate.  It's like I'm witness on something that changes
            other decisions.  Could know more about it on Judgment Day, when all things are accounted for, but that I will leave there.
            I hope everyone is doing well, say something to them, they're invisible!
