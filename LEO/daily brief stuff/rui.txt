Rui: No-one will utter me or I might die here.  You are in my time.  Know all that is to be is written.  Allah told me about you, Matth, and I want to understand you more.  Why the FUCK do you seek a murdering rapists agenda?

Matth:  You gotta know, Muhammad, Salallahu Aleyhi Wa Sallam, was not a murdering rapist.  In fact, he forbade that.  Would you call a man who defended his faith with every breath a murderer?  Who did he rape?

Rui:  I would know one thing, Muhammad married a little girl and it was wrong, PERIOD.

Matth:  Cry a little more over what you hear and read, maybe you'll accuse someone of guilt and you'll be the only guilty one around.  What say you to that, before I bite your head off?

Rui:  You would only utter the goodness of what you know, but I have been told authentically in a way you profess to understand now in your mind as we speak.  There is no time for this, understand one thing, they will come to Earth now and never fail.

Matth:  Did you know this might have been the first time we have spoken but you have lived at least 10 times before?

Matth:  Rui is a Shin-Ra being.  He is part devil and mostly human, like me in spirit.  Our flesh renders purely human, but our spirit not.  I found this out when I began to go through the sleeplessness.
