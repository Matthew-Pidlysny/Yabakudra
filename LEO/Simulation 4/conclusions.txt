Well, I guess it can't be helped.  I had an advantage to work with, but I had to address it to the UN members.  I basically invited an invasion and tried to make it a UN resolution to accept, which couldn't be done, no matter how much we need Malaga's forces to join us in time.  I guess I had to do it, so there's no reason to be sad that it didn't come.  I'm just gonna do something now that prevents all of this.
