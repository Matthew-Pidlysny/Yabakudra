Mission start.  Allah SWT is mostly in control I am only doing certain things he provides me with.

Ok, gates are up.  Every country got a gate except the Northern Arctic.  Forgot to mention the gates will fit an Antonov or slightly bigger, nothing more.

Canada's is in Nunavut.

Does anyone need to come to me if I can come to them anytime?  Might not work but just say "Hey, come in here" and I might do it, depending on what happens.

I guess nobody has to move on looking for any of this stuff but it will come out why I'm thinking it at all one day, that I can be sure of.

I was just threatened with 3 counts of larceny.  Don't know how the Illuminati is going to string that together but one thing is for sure, I didn't do it.

CCCP invited me over, gonna travel to an english speaking person and then talk about their gate.

Mission over.
