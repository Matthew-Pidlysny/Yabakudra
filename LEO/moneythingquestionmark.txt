I want to assume what my locals are doing is good.  I hope everything goes according to plan for you, I know the Order is a slippery foe but has been defeated, we only see it and wait, right?  I know, that person wants me to come in so bad, but there's nothing.  All the desk guys don't know my case, what would they know?  If it ain't popular, nobody really HAS to care.  That's the problem.  Last time I talked about people in my head at the police station I got laughed at.  I'm not doing that again, no matter how hard you want me to.  You're gonna have to make it big or suffer without me, and that's suffering the world.  But I guess it's not easy if you want to win.  Anyway, when I have enough I'll do my own thing, but we can do this together.  God says he's got something big right now going on in the world, but I don't know what it is.  I just sense it's about money.  Keep well, I hope the Order burns!  Yes, I am complicit with their affair, I am Rudna after all.  No, he's not an evil guy.  No, he doesn't work truly for the Order, he only keeps it for God.  Preserver in chief, as it were.  But they all refused Rudna, so goodbye Order.  They don't deserve it, they will ruin society, they will destroy creation.  It's over for them by MY dictate, and they don't like it.  They're being rebellious.  So use that, say you know about Rudna.
