                                                      Mekinde, Unknown Number
==============================================================================================================================================

Operator:  Mekinde Will Start Now, Shemzeki Mamkanka

Please declare your presence as a touch comes upon your world.

1 Kukuk:  You would know I declare this a sovereignty, this can be good indeed, what do we discuss?

2 Bengik:  We declare nothing, we want the same answer, please do it you nuisance!

Operator:  We will discuss things in order as will be described, nothing is spoken by us about your presence.

3 Kuguga:  We declare sovereignty, we obey nothing.

4 Ensiki:  We say bagaga to you all.

Operator:  That concludes the numeroes foes in order of actual ranking.  That can be a manner of discussion, but maybe lowest rank is more desireable to the 3rd, we might say, not to impose too much at one time.  Let number 1 start the conversation and we'll proceed.

1 Kukuk:  We say now that whoever established this ranking system is a defiler, for we see his pretty little world and have a vain coniption of what he might do with it.  

2 Bengik:  We say that we might establish that constraint on us, somehow we are obedient to it at all times point in fact.  Bagaga to you, my friends, gu hu hu I think!

3 Kuguga:  We will perish all of you in our great way, know we have the plans.

Yuda:  I give it to you now, that is my conspiracy with them.  Such is our power, obey it, the Ensiki are my friends indeed!

4 Ensiki:  We say kanana to the monkeys in the 3rd position!

Operator:  So many things to discuss, we can conclude that some kind of foe declares that Ensaga doth reign over a malarky imposed by the Ensiki for having that name, which is not true it can only be of God's great affair after all to have given you an ass to wipe.  It is simple, crack = god, and why?  Maybe you would fancy that it not be, maybe sand come out of the clouds too.  But point in fact, you enjoy that very much.  I give it this way, say whatever you will between one another in anger, I know not if I will stop the foe in question, but we rue them not because they are purposeful foes at all.  I can be quite like that, if you don't mind me saying, unseemingly as it is.  But point moreover, we need to accord what will be done with establishment on it.  Produce your minimum survival gain and seek to list any other fruitful thing you might enjoy in a desert land.

1 Kukuk:  We atrociously deny you the right to seek that over us, if you laugh to hard you might pee, is that right?  Good going, but lets be assured, we need magaha to be exacted to our penis at any time we wish, we will not describe otherwise.  And you can have it that we would also like it not to be a desert as our scribes tell us now, we will no longer speak here but have that man alive.

2 Bengik:  It altogether seems like we might have that, funny we had that weighing scale for eons only to calculate our new existence now.  We can see that is a turmoil.  We need only survive, help us.  

3 Kuguga:  If you deny me this right to speak I will kill all of you.  I will not be beheld by a man of that sort to be some Emho being that I cannot describe as anything but all of this in one spot, doing his will alone.  It's even to the matter that we all fight ourselves and input our discretions through his mind, and we see now that the man is weak of sorts, though sometimes he types so furiously, there it is again!  We declare our sovereignty and see his meme, he knows us and will strike us.  We predict nothing but doom for his mind at this time.  And he is prepared for some reason, by god!  At last I said it, proclaim it Nigger man!

4 Ensiki:  We might say we need only that barzakh exists at minimum, we play everywhere we can go.

Operator:  Participate in the sessions that will be provided to you in the right way.  See how niggers strike their enemy.  This is the end of the session, declare if you are a nigger rival at this time and you will be treated well, but all of you will survive.

2 Bengik:  We declare no Rival, mamma only laughs at that and says we would have fun but be beaten so badly, we do not enjoy that much but can see the fun in challenge, good day!

3 Kuguga:  Begone you fuckwit!

Operator:  We will take that as nigger rival status alignment, is that true?

3 Kuguga:  We see the disparate ones laughing about this, we can see that we might be rivals forever if you say that.

Operator:  Maybe we will let the sessions speak to the inheritance of that.

3 Kuguga:  We also love this to be that he cries over our laughter.  We will see spite in his way and attack.

Operator:  No comment.  

4 Ensiki:  We thank you for surviving us and giving us this great tale, Emho, we laughed so hard at Bagaga!  And there was no greater thing established!

Operator:  Session Over.
