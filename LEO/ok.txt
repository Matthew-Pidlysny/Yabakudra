Codeword Janemba means the Tan Veluga thing might be going.  Just sensed that, but anyone can guide me on what to say right now and I'll sense it.  I guess I'm not leaving here any time soon of my own volition, yes I do enquire rightly as to what Trump has been up to, I want to know but don't have anything real to work on, I know you think I do but my memory is too shot, can't think straight anymore, need therapy.  I guess I can come in later, but I'm scared, gotta let me know how to get in via some convenient public means.  Don't give me nothing, give me todays news.  Anyway, report on Tan Veluga.  I will perform well with your expectation but that means you have to play into my hand and I play into yours.  We'll have a secret subject, called Compartment Subjectivity, and we'll link anything to that once establishing what it is.
