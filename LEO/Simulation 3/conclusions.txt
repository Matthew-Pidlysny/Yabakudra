Ok, so it didn't go wrong, but I definitely promoted one thing early and that got the Illuminati interested in presenting me as a hero, not a tyrant or a murderer.  Anyway, what that ultimately meant is that through the peaceful initiatives I launched, it would seem like I promised one thing about Maclellan being used and then delivered on another thing.  This might have upset expectations in the field, and so thusly I was somewhat doomed by myself.  Anyway, new plan coming, this one will not war on Gaza but we will do a "clean-up" of things.  Primarily, ALL of Earths factions, from the small to the large, will be operating for the survival of Earth in a big way, and we will start the whole thing with a launch of the Gate thing.  But what I am going to do is make multiple gates, it will be a fun thing to discover how to travel to different gates on one world when many are available but you'll see when you pass through.  Anyway, the shields will hold against anything now, and that goes forever.  Point is they can still open your side if they choose, but not the shield in front of it.  Nothing will pass it, and ultimately they'll be trapped behind it until the gate is off or they run back through it.  This gives you an advantage in this situation to have men placed behind the gate if you ever decide you want to keep one, as they will need time to reactivate the gate on your side once it has been turned off by you in order to secure the prisoner from behind.

So let it stand, we're ALL going to do a task now, and I'm going to do what Earth cannot, that is all.  So Allah SWT says this will be it, so let it be so.  Clean-up is coming, so that just means taking forces out of harms way or from inside enemy lines and back home, doing whatever diplomatic work needs be done, just so that we're "presentable" to the races.
