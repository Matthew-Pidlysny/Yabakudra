It began.  Checking is always good, I wouldn't say Allah SWT would do "Enders Game" with me but certainly he will tell me when this is real, if it comes to being only in the works until the "switch" happens then so be it.

Naval blockade was moved out of the way, naval flotilla deployed to create corridor.  You can call aid agencies, they will be fully protected if they come through.

One thing I will say is that I know it is confusing to say that the people alive at the end of the war, when the bank takes over, will be released at that time, but it is fair to say we sack the world at that time to prepare.  I guess they will only ask me about this later, so what I will say is that I will make my assurances where I need to, for everybody's sake, being vague here is good.

All forces dying will be taken to Allah SWT before being placed in the place.

Funny thing, 2 jets tried attacking me and so I took them down, the parachutes didn't deploy properly!  I would say you would all do well to just double check that on your jets before any launch is taken from here on in, because you would figure they would have had that under control with proper folding.

Just had a meeting with Netanyahu.  He's on our side for sure, can't tell him everything yet but I did negotiate a peace between us, leaving gaza so that this can happen in exchange for a religious movement around the red heifers.  Allah SWT wants to show them the Shirk of it, and the blessing they will get by doing it this time.

Hamas has been negotiated with.  They will stand down for now.  Pending Iran's decision, we will see what needs to be done.

My aerial flotilla and naval flotilla are in place, and Gaza has been restored.  Just accommodating the people needing to know things about stuff like the new assembly building and stuff.

Mission over.
