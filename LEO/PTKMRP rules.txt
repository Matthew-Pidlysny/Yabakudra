Rules for Primordial/Transcendent Knowledge and Matter Realignment Program (PTKMRP)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  No immortality

2.  No altering, realigning, rearranging, or completely removing of the Signs of Judgment Day according to Islam

3.  If you create "Lifeless Goons", you will know your penance in this world.

4.  Whenever you wave your hand and expect me to fill in the gaps, you will say "Inna Rabbika Anhuma", then wave your hand.



a.  When you come into something that brings you sorrow, change it right away, or you just make things worse for yourself and others.

b.  The agency for dealing with Satan has been arranged, you may avoid this as you know not my required punishment, nor my criteria for punishing him in this way.

c.  When it comes to the evil of men, know that it is a magnet which will pull equitable evil from you, according to your interests.

d.  Unite your entire planet if you are to be fruitful, if not your division, if not your galaxy, if not your area, if not the place.

e.  You may create institutions and objects which are made to bring worship to you somehow, even incarnate temporal beings if you will, but know that because of some people who enter this fight those things will likely fail you in some way.

f.  When you raise another soul into this world, either dead from this experience or otherwise, you will have earned it either before or after.

g.  There is a term called Harza, which means a life which is born like a "Lifeless Goon", but in a manner that it can fully grow even though it would have innate disposition and knowledge.  You will know Adam to have been one of these by right, but he never knew that word, I invent that this year.

h.  One can imagine computer control, but with the knowledge to see things coming within a period of a day, then you should be fine.
