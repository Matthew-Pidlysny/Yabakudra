Permanent Peace Treaty's are hard to come by.  For example, there are many people in both Palestine and in Israel, and they all have differing views.  Politics unites some of them, but divides those who are united against the rest.  So religion, which has the power to unify, will solidify this.  I do this for the Israeli's then, I will secure them a right to do the Red Heifer sacrifice without troubles being laid on them, and I make West Bank and Palestine a bustling utopia.  Seeing Allah SWT work will make everybody follow, if you want me to start a movement I will but I prefer not in insert and create a revolt in a society I plan not to cause a revolt in.  I will appear, therefore, to some people in their time of need in my fancy armor that Allah SWT created for me in my visions.  This will generate the momentum for a proper "Movement" which can guide those who manage and do things for the people such as the government of Israel, who will then manage their people over their thing.

What else can be said about it?  I guess I will try my best to secure what I must if I must.  If this is our manner of talking then so be it, I have no way of identifying whether things are happening out there until it becomes news so if I sound weird in the meantime don't worry.  I'll make folders for all my attempts from here on in.
