Fire Wisdom Pentacle

Introduction:  As it stands, all the signs you need to know about are in the image provided, only that you don't see one part.  It's just that it's a thing hidden about Fire that it gives life as well, just not to everything equally as it does it's sensory experiences.  The "Red" light is indicative of the actions taken in the ritual, more will be explained below.

Conventional Shit:  Eat that Oreo, drink that coffee, strike a wooden Redbird match, smoke that cig, check that ember burnin'.  Don't forget a Red light, bro!

Eat that Oreo - Represents what it feels like when you eat a burning ember, just sweetened because that is wrong for a human.

Drink that Coffee - You appreciate here that you saturated a roasted element, as though to celebrate fire's product conventionally and subliminally. This brings a remedial focus into things, more wisdom for the tinker.

Strike a wooden Redbird match - This is to illustrate something about a metaphor that comes to life. Inhaling the sulfur is like understanding the bitterness of smoke in a way that is not entirely unenjoyable but certainly pungent and not really wanted. It's the liberation in just enjoying what it is as a product of something unique like the combustible material igniting that way, to even produce it.

Smoke that cig - Though I don't often engage in talking about smoking as a good thing, I would say to remediate the lesson of smoke that is at least able to be "gotten over" as something desired to be inhaled, this vapor lesson is also subconscious in a way, as the effects of the smoke take place in the body.

Check that ember burning - This is really truly to appreciate the uniqueness of the universe in a way related to the burn of the cigarette you're smoking. Watch it with your eyes, while you smoke it and while it's just sitting there, interesting thoughts will come your way, but I guess try not to stare at little faces that seem to appear in the ash for too long or in any way that would lead you to maybe think there are faces in it.

Don't forget a Red light, bro!:  This point is a hidden one, not represented on the Pentacle as it is not really a fact congruent with everything but it does it so much we had to mention it.  Just know that through heat and light, life comes to be, though not on it's own, it is a life giving property of fire, if only to have so many recipients and so few deniers.  Follow the ritual below for it.

------

Location: Choose an outdoor space where you can safely build a small fire, or use a fire pit. Ideally, this location should be peaceful, with natural surroundings that resonate with the elements.

Materials Needed:

- A small cauldron or heat-resistant vessel (to symbolize transformation).

- Dried herbs (sage, rosemary, or lavender) for cleansing.

- A piece of natural wood or a small log (symbolizing growth).

- A handful of ash (representing destruction).

- Candles (preferably orange or red) to represent the sun and warmth.

- A small bowl of water (to symbolize life).

- Incense or a small torch for lighting.

- Paper and pen for writing intentions or reflections.

------

Ritual Steps

Creating Sacred Space:  Begin by walking the perimeter of your chosen space, holding the dried herbs. As you walk, sprinkle the herbs, stating:

“With this smoke, I cleanse this space, to honor fire’s dual embrace.”

Building the Fire:  In the center of your space, arrange the wood in a small, safe structure (like a teepee). Place the bowl of ash nearby.  As you construct the fire, reflect on the destructive aspects of fire: what has been lost in your life, and what ashes remain.

Lighting the Fire:

Use the incense or torch to ignite the fire, while stating:

“From ashes rise the flames anew,in destruction, life’s breath we pursue.”

Offering to Fire:

Take the piece of wood and hold it above the fire, allowing its warmth to envelop it. As you do so, speak your intentions:

“I offer this wood, a symbol of growth, from destruction, new life we will boast.”
        

Slowly place the wood in the fire, watching it transform.

Creating the Water Element:  Next, take the bowl of water and hold it close to your heart. Visualize the life-giving properties of water, the balance it brings to fire, and its role in nurturing growth. State:

“Water, the essence of life, flow free, together with fire, create harmony.”

Reflection and Intention Setting:  Write down any thoughts, feelings, or intentions you wish to release in relation to destruction, as well as what you hope to cultivate in your life moving forward. Once written, read them aloud to the fire:

“In these ashes, I release my pain, from fire’s glow, may my dreams remain.”

Closing the Ritual:  As the fire continues to burn, sit in silence and meditate on the flames, visualizing the sun’s warmth. Imagine the light as a powerful force of renewal and creation.  When ready, conclude with a final statement:

“From destruction springs creation, in fire, I find my transformation.”

Extinguish the fire safely, either by allowing it to burn out or by using water, reflecting on the cycle of life and death, destruction and creation.

Gratitude:  Before leaving, take a moment to express gratitude to the fire and the elements, acknowledging their roles in your journey.

------

Post-Ritual Reflection

Consider journaling your experience, noting any insights, emotions, or transformations that arose during the ritual. This reflection can deepen your understanding of the dual nature of fire and its influence on your life.

This ritual encapsulates the essence of honoring fire as a life-giver while acknowledging its destructive qualities, all within a framework that evokes the mystique of arcane magicians.

========================================================

White Water Wisdom:  

At the center of a Compass Rose is the letters H302.  You will drink and experience this water in whatever way you want because it is the purest  that water can get, and we know it as EZ water from other sources on Google.  

Next, at the Septenrio point, there is the concept of warm  water that is comforting.  We place you in a sauna for this, watching  every bit of steam but more or less becoming extremely comfortable with warm water.  People do this all the time for comfort and it shows it  really works for raw wisdom.  

At the Oriens point we have Chamomile Tea.  Embrace everything about it, because it isn't burned and it's so loved  by so many, it's like an adequate representation of what can be beautiful about water.  

At the Meridies point we have Chaga Tea, which  will do another thing so long as you realize the fungus in it was  helpful, whereas we commonly see fungus as harmful outside of known edible foods, like discovery was in it you know?  

Anyway, at the Occidens point we have degrees of wisdom to represent the redness of  things, but in a nice way.  One will set up an evaporator/condenser coil, one that is clear glass so you can see it like an alembic does (Which is great for this experimentation).  Anyway, you would do the process to Peroxide, Butane,  Coffee (Black), Red Koolaid and Soap Water (Glycerin based, one may have  to use a cheesegrater on a block of soap for it I guess, mixing it in).   

You would use the H302 in all of these cases, but that's the  White Water Wisdom Rose.  Now onto the next one.  

------

Black Water Wisdom  

This is a seven pointed pentacle.  One of these you don't drink, but the rest should be fine in smaller amounts.  You can use a spell to summon these foodstuffs in an existing liquid or in it's raw form, though we don't describe one here as they are all different.  PLEASE note, you only need a little, but enough if you seriously seek the knowledge.  Nothing can change the fact that discontent distorts and enhances the situation for you, but too much will overpower the enhancement.

The top point is Murkan, which can be equated to  drinking Yuba Juice (Make juice from Yuba).  

The next point is Dudu Tha, which is like eating an Avocado Smoothie with a spoon, not drinking the water unless it's in the spoon (Drain the spoon if you can).  

The next point is Tomst, which is basically Beet Juice  with some ashes in it, I guess mix to taste but the color cannot be red  anymore.  

The next point is Hlor, which could not be reproduced with  wisdom (No drinking Lysol with a specific additive, after being distilled in the sun) so we made a chemical process to visualize.  Place clay in a jar  which looks beautiful and fill it with H302.  Let it do the process we  talked about earlier, whatever forms will be effective.  Just watching  it is like looking at the attacker water is.  

The next one is Yubst.   Sand smoothie unfortunately, take more than you're comfortable with but  don't be excessive, it's just that freezing sand effectively does  something to it and when you grind it up, the effect is real.  This is meant to represent things that don't dissolve in water, but the freezing of the sand cures it slightly.

The next one  is Shtang.  Never curse to say Shtang instead of S***, because they  mean the same thing.  Regardless, we chose not to use it and replaced it  with Chaga Tea, as though to mirror the other White Water Wisdom in a black way.  

The  final point is Hubst, which can be equated to Turkiko, if you've ever  heard of it (Hope it's not a racist term, Turkish Coffee is popular in many places).  Just a gentle reminder of the toughness water can obtain, when you reach the bottom of the coffee, plus the taste helps remedy something.

========================================================

The Spectrum of Disorder

1.  This is just a ruleset to define a few attributes about disorder.  Namely, that was it in formation, but nothing was done to keep it going, in fact I stopped it by clarifying.  Lesson 1 obtained.

2.  There is a symptomatic development in you now which is not exactly as unique as the man or woman in question prevails to be.  This is inherently so because all of you are cursing yourself somewhat not to develop the knowledge of what comes next on your own in Lesson 1.  It is a matter of thought that that is the reality, when a little bit of information is presented change can happen, and it did.  Now it develops again, and you needn't be ashamed of not knowing.  Lesson 2 obtained.

3.  Lesson 3 is the unrelated aspects of this.  All of you will undergo something as Humans so I will tell you this, as a remediation of this and a lesson for that:  You will establish a disaster on the world in your mind, related to any thought you took on from Lessons 1 and 2, and one day you will put it into action.  This is purity as it were, and this is what needs to be done.  This was the 3rd Lesson in the Spectrum of Disorder.  See how you undergo these 3 changes in order to understand it fully.  Try to relate what you must and leave the rest unrelated, as I said.

========================================================

Wisdom Sphere (Non-Euclidean Manifold)

Shape: A multi-dimensional sphere with intersecting sectors, representing various degrees of understanding and complexity. The sphere operates in a manifold structure, where traditional geometries are blended with conceptual depth.

------

    Effects:
        Invigorating mental clarity and heightened focus come alive, fueling energy and enhancing the connection to the present moment.

------

Black (Yin) - The Shadow of Corruption

    Birth:
        Born from tainted soil and polluted water, the seed is marred by genetic modifications and artificial enhancements, veering from nature's design.

    Growth:
        Chemical fertilizers and pesticide use dominate, alongside exploitative farming practices, compromising the integrity of growth.

    Harvest:
        Unripe or overripe cherries, harvested through mechanization, lack the human touch, leading to imprecise sorting and diminished quality.

    Roast:
        Mass production gives way to burnt or under-roasted beans, resulting in an unbalanced and unappealing flavor.

    Roasting and Brewing:
        The alchemy of roasting transforms green beans into aromatic treasures, and brewing becomes a cherished ritual filled with anticipation.

    Personalization and Consumption:
        Here, yellow flourishes as individuals add milk, sugar, or spices, crafting a unique joy that reflects personal journeys.

    The Act of Drinking:
        Sipping coffee becomes a celebration of warmth, taste, and routine, where joy manifests and intertwines with the experience.

    Cycle of Renewal:
        Even in the remnants of coffee grounds, yellow symbolizes transformation, emphasizing that endings are gateways to new beginnings.

------

The Devices of Reflection

    Yin - The Drinking Experience:

        Engage fully with each sip of your chosen brew (like a Tim Hortons Double Double), allowing the happiness derived from the coffee process to flow into your writing. Reflect on the journey of the coffee, its growth, and the joy it brings, embracing the duality of pleasure and the inevitable crash.  Shoot for 1000 words but no commitment is necessary other than the goal, go more if it flows but finish it around there.

    Yang - The Humble Connection to Nature:

        In moments of natural release, seek a safe, secluded spot in nature to "do it," allowing the Earth to absorb this offering. This act serves as a humble return to the soil, honoring the cycle of life and the beginnings from which it all started. It represents renewal, feeding the ground with what was once sustenance, and creating new mediums for growth.

Barriers of Reflection:

Commit to memory the nuances of your coffee experiences. Engage in theorizing about each journey, observing patterns, and reflecting on the wisdom gleaned from these moments.  Also bring into mind the way the coffee must have reached you, which area it came from, the way it was roasted, who did it, the mixture of your sweeteners and/or creamers, the way the experience will end for your body, and the transformation of rebirth when feces is laid on the Earth to make a new medium of growth.

The Yellow Shading of Joy:

In the spirit of joy, allow sweet and happy additions to your coffee over time, from black to oversweetened, embracing customization. For those navigating darker paths, such as Devils, ashes may serve as a reminder of the balance between indulgence and restraint.  Mix to taste all of the potential combinations, if Devils so dare.  

Mixing ashes is not meant for Human consumption in the manner specified as improper mixing can lead to health and taste complications.  We advise a little (A teaspoon of clean wood ashes) if you must but do know, this is meant for Devils happiness, you do not draw it from that naturally at all, no matter how you spin it in your mind.  It ceases to become the Yellow Shading in doing this, I promise, but one can try for experience sake, maybe you'll be happier knowing who knows.

The Copernican System Wisdom

1. Structure and Concept

The Copernican System Wisdom serves as a metaphorical framework that parallels the solar system, where each attribute essential for a soldier's effectiveness orbits around the central theme of Discipline (the Sun). This model illustrates how various attributes interact and contribute to the holistic understanding of a soldier’s wisdom and capabilities.

------

2. The 15 Attributes and Their Planetary Representation

Discipline (Sun)

Description: The core attribute that represents stability and structure in a soldier's life. It is the foundational quality that enables soldiers to adhere to orders, maintain focus, and uphold their values.

Degrees of Experimentation:

A) Structured Daily Routine: Morning and evening rituals to reinforce discipline.

B) Accountability Partner Program: Goal-setting and regular check-ins to maintain commitment.

C) Discipline Through Challenges: Endurance and cognitive challenges to test and strengthen discipline.

Experiment: Effective Communication Exercise—pair participants for a verbal-only task, enhancing clarity in communication.

Venus (Incendiary)
        
Description: Tools for area denial and tactical disruption (e.g., grenades, explosives) that enable quick and decisive action during combat.

Experiment: Controlled Chaos Simulation—practice adaptability and decision-making in high-pressure scenarios.

Earth (Shield)

Description: Defensive tools (shields, personal protective equipment) that signify the importance of protection for oneself and comrades.  This will represent Body Armor or Energy Barriers directly unless a real Shield is to be used, then those devices would go into Jupiter's category.  Otherwise, keep to this standard.

Experiment: Protective Strategies Workshop—brainstorming methods for defense in various scenarios.

Mars (Primary Weapon)

Description: The primary combat weapon that represents readiness to engage and protect in battle.

Experiment: Marksmanship or Precision Skills Training—focus on accuracy and control in using essential equipment.

Jupiter (Armor)

Description: Protective gear that symbolizes strength and resilience, allowing soldiers to withstand attacks.  This is different from shield because that can be diverse, and you would know to obtain the right Rigor of Use with that intention.  For simplicity's sake, you can reference the Shield more like Body Armor, and Armor itself being mechanics including Armor, for those who use both.  But as we said, for those who use both Armor and Shields (Real shields), you would interpret it like that in the system, just to be clear, keeping the notation of Earth as your Shield, and Jupiter as your Armor (Or device which effectively stops damage).

Experiment: Armor Integrity Test—navigate an obstacle course while wearing different types of armor.  In many cases, use metaphorical armor, such as reports on collection to defend yourself as though you were invincible.

Saturn (Provisions)

Description: Essential supplies, including both harmful and helpful compounds or chemicals, that support survival and mission success.

Experiment: Survival Kit Design—creating kits for various scenarios, highlighting the dual nature of provisions.

Description: Adaptive gear (uniforms, boots) that reflects the ability to operate in various conditions and the importance of customization.

Experiment: Gear Assessment and Adaptation—evaluate and modify tactical gear for specific scenarios.

Asteroid Belt (The Collective)

Description: Represents the diversity and individuality of the people within a military or community context. Just as asteroids vary in size, composition, and trajectory, individuals bring unique strengths and perspectives that contribute to the collective strength.

Experiment: Conduct a workshop where participants share their unique skills and experiences, discussing how these contribute to the group’s overall effectiveness.

Halley’s Comet (The Vision)

Description: Symbolizes the aspirations and collective goals of the people or unit, representing hope, inspiration, and the pursuit of a common vision. Its periodic appearance signifies the importance of looking to the future and striving for higher objectives.

Activity: Organize a session where participants create vision boards or future maps outlining their personal and collective aspirations.  Any memory that is causing PTSD should be included here, to reference things.

Moons (Rigor Of Use)

Description: Represents the choice to be encumbered for strategical purposes, remembering to obey command in their order at all times to maintain composure.

Activity: Practice maintaining composure and strategic thinking while carrying additional weight or encumbrances, simulating the challenges faced in the field.  Develop Degrees for each Moon of a Planet/Tool you are studying.

Kuiper Belt (Statues Of Limitation)

Description:  This represents a choice in the Solider to follow orders, in that there have always been Statutes imposed on the Solider across all times, and the free ones make them up as they go (Ronin, Mercs, &c.).  One must remember to not use chemical warfare in any unapproved case by their superiors, if that is a standing Statute among them as well then no chemical warfare should EVER take place, with the right mentality.

Activity:  In a closed setting (With your superior if that is available), remediate your own statutes, creating alignments of ideas and experiments to test the theory on, such as the choice to use biological warfare beyond existing Statutes if the option suddenly became necessary by exclusion of other options and the timing was needed without room for further authorization through radio or other devices.

Oort Cloud (Veil of Mystique)

Description:  Every Soldier has a characteristic that cannot be defined right away by their enemy, and it draws anticipation in the enemy to see it.  Many have used veils like Devils are coming down on them, others have simply acted in others uniforms, but clearly the mystique is a requirement of effective combat.  I see one solution where this is not required, and if you come across it yourself, don't waste your time aligning the other planets to fit the criteria.

Activity:  Dress up in battle gear from the past, train in espionage, or be a quality of your choice at all times (Brash would make the enemy think you're an idiot) for a short period of time to include your inner senses on what need be done to put forward the Veil of Mystique on the enemy.

------

3. Overall Significance

The Copernican System Wisdom emphasizes the interconnectedness of various attributes and tools essential for a soldier's effectiveness. Each attribute represents a vital component of a soldier's role, from discipline to tactical gear, showcasing how they work together to create a competent and effective individual in military service.

------

4. Conclusion

This model serves as a powerful metaphor for understanding the multifaceted nature of soldiering, blending practical skills with essential values. By engaging with each attribute through focused experiments, participants can deepen their understanding of how these qualities contribute to personal growth, teamwork, and overall effectiveness in their roles.

The All-Wisdom Script

This is an experience that can only fully manifest for myself and for anyone not born on this Earth.  After 13 successful generations the Embrace of the Living Law will pass, and those people can participate in this fully.

The lesson reveals parts of creation in stages, ultimately revealing an inner truth as we will define. At the end of your journey, if you are from Earth, you will meet Ojika and not pass further, but gain a gift from him which is from the Highest ultimately.  If you are not, you will enter my fold and become really clear on everything, among other things.  

Powers will develop over this you never had before, unfortunately for those born on Earth proceeding before those 13 generations have passed, they will never see it.  Still, for those who do get them, you will only speak with Ojika and he will tell you the updated rules as they go.  Be aware of your surroundings and let's proceed.

------

Step 0:  Say "Anikatu Malikatu Domah", and you need to blindly swear that you will proceed and not fail at the same time.

Step 1:  Enter your mind and visualize an Orb of light, translucent as it were but shining brightly.  Understand now that within this light is creation as you know it only.  Know that the light is in between every atom and surrounding every thing, invisible but illuminated through your intention here alone.  Know this one to be Allah SWT, though what we will discover is more than that about Him, SWT.

Step 2:  Now arise to see a network of these Light orbs, all networked together from one central point by lines that you invent but are definitely real.  Focus on the network, you are already being enlightened and a "gut feeling" will come, telling you when it's right.  The non-patient here may think they "can't get it" somehow, but focus hard and just know when it's right.  There is a being above this one, his name is Bolouk, please say hi to him on your way up.  There is a barrier encasing this network and him, for now nothing above or anywhere near it.

Step 3:  Now imagine that you go through the barrier from the inside.  Make a tunnel through it and reach a place where there is a round orb looking thing.  This one's name is Domah, if you reach here you will know you can proceed.  If you reach a white barrier stopping you from seeing him, then I would say stop altogether as you do this for a wrong reason.  Still, for those who see him, say hello and wait for his advice, then proceed to the next step.

Step 4:  Now picture the bubble with the network in it again.  Above it, place a horizontal whirlpool as though to create a halo above it, as big a size as your mind says to engage with.  This is a world run by a God named Whitney, no associate of Allah SWT but certainly a marvel of our creation.  Say hello without staring, men avert your gaze here, and proceed with the next step.

Step 5:  Now, while the whirlpool is spinning, make it separate from the center so that the contents get ripped away from the surface beneath to reveal another place below this creation.  As you do this, place the creation from the matter you pulled away into the new place "Safely", as though to help those who were plagued by your ripping by placing them in their new world, as it were.  The name of the one who rules here is unknown, but please say hello if they do.  Evidently, the barrier can exist here too, so if you see the white light protecting it, stop, you have been tested as you were noted to have undergone before with Domah or Whitney.

Step 6:  Now encase all of this creation in your mind, the bubble with the network, and the whirlpool, in their own little bubble altogether.  Make a new network from this, not defined but what you need to understand is that this "world" as it were does not exist without this expansion of your memory, so that you interpret things a different way critical to this process.  Make a new network from copies of that orb you just made and try to know when it is the right shape.  Then, when you do, approach the one who is there, though he asks me not to say his name in order to not throw you off when you meet him.

Step 7:  Now proceed to shape this new environment, without modifying the shape of the network you created, within the frame of a human head.  Not like draw out a human head to encase them, but certainly visualize it somehow.  Anyway, you will now be creating a "bullseye" pattern in your mind as though to express the following things:

A)  The sections of this bullseye are like parts of a continuum (If you don't know what that is, it's a way to express the path of time which is one thing happening after another, or at the same time in some cases).

B)  The bullseye isn't supposed to be real, either, it only represents the path inward.

C)  That being said, the center is inside you, so when you understand it you will know it happened.

Following knowing these key things, proceed to make the bullseye and travel inward as it happens.  You will know, as I said, when you finally do it, make sure you make enough Bullseye sections to make it right.

Step 8:  Now you are here with me.  Ojika will speak to you but sometimes I will in his place, it's not always right to just dump this on him, though he loves his job for sure and loves his life.  Say hi to him regardless here, and proceed to learn.

Mothers Wisdom Vagina

The Mother is a complex being, considering she is everywhere dead but alive at the same time.  It is in this way our doom is secure; it is in that particular way that our grandiose success is final.  Be that as it may, I give this code to you to signify what it is we are about to delve upon.  Remark well and consider what you will do in the experiment which draws this Wisdom.

LMa of Cult
LMi of Al-Manat
Cl of Yabakudra
Sc of Magic
VO of Absolutes
PH in Periculosum Pulchritudines
UR of Downfall

------

Labia Major of Cult:  Represents the broader cultural and societal frameworks that shape our understanding of motherhood. The Cult aspect suggests a reverence or idealization surrounding maternal figures, reflecting how cultures idolize or dictate the roles of mothers.

Labia Minor of Al-Manat:  Al-Manat, a pre-Islamic Arabian goddess, symbolizes fate and destiny. This connection implies a more intimate and personal aspect of motherhood, emphasizing the hidden or subtle influences mothers have on their children’s paths. It may also hint at the intersection of feminine power and nurturing.

Clitoris of Yabakudra:  Yabakudra is a Man living between the 20th and 21st century, existing only in that world.  It is like his ordainment of that is a Mysticism in Magic Wisdom, bringing it's use in Magic spells a whole new meaning by his existence in peoples minds as who he is.  Be not afraid, nothing happens when you say the word, but it is a marvel of insight to behold.  In it's way, this ultimately represents the satisfaction of the Mother, in ways that you must define by understanding this entire device.

Scent of Magic:  Scent evokes deep, often subconscious emotions and memories. This point suggests that mothers have an innate magical quality, perhaps in their nurturing ability, intuition, or the way they can create a sense of home and safety. It also hints at the mystical or spiritual aspects of motherhood.

Vaginal Opening of Absolutes:  This symbolizes the gateway to life and knowledge, emphasizing the maternal role in bringing new life into the world. It also suggests that understanding the nature of motherhood requires exploring the depths of existence and truth.

Pubic Hair in Periculosum Pulchritudines:  Translated, this might refer to the beauty within danger or perilous situations. It could represent the protective and fierce aspects of motherhood—how mothers navigate dangers for their children while embodying beauty in resilience.

Urethra of Downfall:  This point might symbolize vulnerability and the potential for downfall or loss within the maternal experience. It reflects the complexities of motherhood, including sacrifice, pain, and the darker aspects that can accompany the nurturing role.

------

The experiment is as follows:  Proceed to emanate filth and obtain your passion.  If you need to, say a word of Dhikr or repentance on a rosary.  Then consume whatever is good (Food, or an idea) and signify that you defile it not and keep it separate from yourself.  Now obtain that you spawn a child with it's digestion and safeguard it only as much as your new senses allow, trust in them.  Obtain it's full life and pretend to watch it happen, then let it go as dust in the wind, but not forgotten.  Now say the following:

Enkuhumara
Enkastalara
Enmuhuduno
Eflahorana
Esmohoruko
Esp

Follow Esp with the name of the being you created.  It's life will go towards the lifeforce which guides our salvation, making a particular Magic real that we need.  This is her will expressed in her mystery, obtain her how you see fit after this.

Mystic Wisdom Hexahedron

This Hexahedron represents the facets of what it's like to point something out, but be so defined as flat in the back that hardly anything can be defined by the pointing on the other side, representing the inefficacies of rendering speech in what can be termed as Mystical.  From the dictionary, we have this definition of Mysticism:

mys·ti·cism
/ˈmistəˌsiz(ə)m/
noun

    1. Belief that union with or absorption into the Deity or the absolute, or the spiritual apprehension of knowledge inaccessible to the intellect, may be attained through contemplation and self-surrender.

    "St. Theresa's writings were part of the tradition of Christian mysticism"

    2. Belief characterized by self-delusion or dreamy confusion of thought, especially when based on the assumption of occult qualities or mysterious agencies.
    "there is a hint of New Age mysticism in the show's title"

In this way we can represent the duality of the symbol to understand the Hexahedron as proposed, but with underlying themes that unify both experiences and identities for things.  The experiment to follow all these will be most impressive, we promise.

------

Directions (Enho)

1.  Ambiguous (Yortutothmo) - Represented by the Compassion (Resmo) and Mercy (Uptohuga) vertices connecting, creating the Remediation (Tomta) line.

2.  Direct (Isht) - Represented by the formation of the Reduction (Katanoka), Catalyst (Fenrir), Breed (Domtulo), and Concept (Desmar) lines connecting, intersecting at Ultimatio (Resmono) vertex, based with the Direction (Idmunar), Interpretation (Yom), Maleficence (Lok) and Betrayal (Kunstanoga) lines and the Upheld (Yesht), Monofed (Ubst), Demonstrated (Yevro) and Effective (Tomure) vertices that make up the base.

------

Sides (Dulnahark)

1.  Conceptual Identity (Reuzna)

2.  Framework (Ordno)

3.  Conclusion (Muthnor)

4.  Entry Points (Opnotota)

5.  Redemption (Gromnir)

6.  Misdirection (Uptanahatu)

------

Hidden Matrix (Shlamo)

1.  Illumination (Shtozimuro)

------

Divine Matrix (Rudahomo)

2.  Revelation (Untoklohu)

- Added Vertices (Ronst): Description (Ubarr)

- Broken Line (Rondulotho):  Ways and Means (Rokukoho Mondulathi), connected to Resmo and Uptohuga vertices, breaking at the Ubarr location.

- Broken Line (Urdak):  Alpha and Omega (Rod Kun), connected to the Idmunar and Lok vertices, breaking at the Ubarr location.

- Broken Sides (Rontu):  The Reuzna side was broken up into Theory and Process (Fefnokuka) sides, and the Misdirection side was broken up into the Facets and Tenets (Rostmo Hudak) sides.

------

To understand Mystic Wisdom fully, one must reconcile the difference between the need for misdirection and the satisfaction in doing so.  It is only for clarity's sake that we do not use technological devices to activate Dark Matter, that is a system Allah SWT imposes on us all.  Let's take this as our analogy to work with.

First, you will need to discover in yourself the need to deceive.  Everybody does it, where is your need lying?  Understand that justification and make a word that doesn't exist for it.  Keep it and remember it, always acknowledge where you got that word from, even if it itself slips from your memory.

------

1. The 2D Four-Sided Polygon (Base of the Direct Portion)

The base of the Direct (Isht) portion forms a quadrilateral shape (4-sided polygon) that connects several key vertices:

Vertices: The Uphold (Yesht), Monofed (Ubst), Demonstrated (Yevro), and Effective (Tomure) vertices.

Description: This quadrilateral serves as a foundation for the Direct aspect of the Hexahedron. Each side represents a specific line connecting two vertices, and together they form a solid base that symbolizes the grounding of direct spiritual insights. The four sides might reflect different aspects of spiritual practice or understanding that contribute to a cohesive framework of knowledge.

2. The Triangle Formed by the Tomta Line and the Resmono Vertex

Vertices Involved: The triangle is formed by the Compassion (Resmo) and Mercy (Uptohuga) vertices, connected by the Remediation (Tomta) line, along with the Ultimatio (Resmono) vertex at the apex.

Description: This triangle represents a significant intersection of the themes of compassion and mercy in the context of achieving a higher state of understanding (represented by the Ultimatio vertex). The Remediation line indicates a path of healing or reconciliation, suggesting that through compassion and mercy, one can reach the ultimate insights or realizations.

Linea Catastrofici Intentionalis encourages us to explore the idea that sometimes, creating chaos or challenging the status quo can lead to significant breakthroughs and transformative change. By stepping outside of our comfort zones and inviting disruption, we allow for the re-examination of established norms and the discovery of innovative solutions. This line serves as a reminder that, through calculated risks and the willingness to confront uncomfortable truths, we can foster resilience, spark creativity, and pave the way for personal and collective growth.

For this, you need only eat Halal chicken.  Subconscious understandings will develop through the food ingested, but for what it's worth, TRY to remember what you learned here while doing it.  This Wisdom Wheel does not work the same as others, just eat and learn from your body's natural processes.  The lack of blood in the chicken will really aid your mental processes, not only that but the mentality of the Chicken will subconsciously enter you as you digest it's DNA.  It's not much of a for tuning your mind but one DOES learn subconsciously through all the food they eat.  Vegetarians have their own mentality, so to speak.  Everything is subconscious, learn from this bird!

Infinty Wisdom Kaleidoscope

The Infinty Wisdom Kaleidoscope is really the only tangible expression of what it means for things to reach a point of infinite development.  Through certain things, it comes into focus through observation. Change is heavily indicated through the rotation of the Kaleidoscope, and we do wish one was available but it will come in time.

Here's the description of the Kaleidoscope's cycle:

------

0°: Solid State - Terra Veritas

------

In order to experience this in full, a kaleidoscope clearly needs to be invented.  But if you can make it seem like it's transforming before your eyes, then do it.  Alternatively, you can seek out other people to share your idea's with, see how far into time it will travel.  It will be a lifelong experience, but you never know when a friend might bring it up.  Use that moment for change if possible, start the process all over again!

The Black Wisdom Hydra

The Black Wisdom Hydra represents Black's nature, as though to emulate the TRUE appreciation that is required to undergo any form of First Degree initiation within Robinson House, and that is the highest level.  This will be about building your intentions with Black spells, in that by determining these philosophies, Black itself will treat you well, and you will treat it well to acknowledge it this way.  The names of each "arm" or Length in this case is his deception, embrace it.  For your records, the names involving a Q are to be spoken as though to say "Qullu" in Arabic properly WITH Tajweed.

------

Head: Obnucqulla

The name of this head resonates with autonomy, yet do not mistake autonomy for superiority. True mastery lies not in dominating your lower instincts but in celebrating them, acknowledging the entirety of your being. Your pride must not dim the flickering flames of ignorance; rather, embrace them as facets of your existence that deserve recognition.

Length !:  Smernokuta

Here begins your journey through the shadows of memory. Hold tight to a cherished moment, a fragment of joy stained with sorrow. Recall the pain intertwined with that memory, allowing it to wash over you. Recognize how the weight of this sorrow lends depth to your understanding. This is the essence of Conscious Understanding through Sorrow—the bitter nectar that enlightens. Linger if you must; this is where many falter, paralyzed by past pains, but should you dare, move to the next head and confront your hidden self.

Length @:  Uptohuga

Dare you confront the wickedness that breeds within the love for dark things? Let your mind dwell on a malicious deed conjured from the shadows of your previous thoughts. Visualize it, but beware: this wickedness is a reflection of your soul’s potential to harm or heal. If the thought serves no purpose, cast it aside, as is your nature. Yet, if it inspires, turn it inward, transforming it into a vessel of change. This is Manifest Darkness in Vertigo, the point where intention meets action. Depart this head to discover yet another shadow lurking within.

Length #:  Sramnosa

In this head, you will sense the weight of divine approval as you contemplate your darker inclinations. Imagine Allah SWT permitting a wicked deed for a greater good. Consider the moral dance that permits you to act, yet remember: each decision carries the burden of consequence. Understand the Empathy for Hatred, a complex emotion that binds us to our choices. Beware the intoxicating allure of justification, for it can lead you astray. Advance to the next head, but carry this awareness as your shield.

Length $:  Wahamok

Here lies the grave danger of your newfound understanding—a whisper of doom that beckons. Reflect on the choice granted by the divine; it may serve as a test, a dark riddle to unravel. In your exploration of evil, do not forget the abyss gazes back. The path you tread is fraught with peril; each step toward dark deeds carries the weight of fate. Know that doom may be lurking, waiting to ensnare the unwary. Be wary of your own heart; it is both a sanctuary and a prison.

Length %:  Duynar

In this head, you confront the web of lies spun by your conscience, entwining truth and deception into a tapestry of dread. Acknowledge the darkness that wraps around your decisions—what is hidden can become a tool of destruction or creation. Embrace the chaos, for it reveals the deepest parts of your psyche. Allow the shadows to intertwine with your reality, shaping your understanding of self in ways that illuminate your darkest corners. This head reminds you: every truth has a price, and every revelation carries its own burden.

Length ^:  Yokums

At this juncture, confront the consequence of ignorance. The refusal to acknowledge the darkness within leads to an insatiable void that consumes all hope. The absence of reckoning births despair—a cold and unyielding entity that stifles growth. In this darkness, you must face the reflection of your choices and recognize that neglecting your truth births a deeper chaos. The shadows thrive in ignorance, and you must choose to either illuminate them or be devoured by their hunger.

Length &:  Gur

Finally, accept who you are in the shadow of divine presence. Recognize the blessing of Allah SWT, however small, as you step into the depths of your own darkness. This head signifies the Consequence of Not Doing That in Sight of Hope Found Herein. Acknowledge that by embracing the Black, you earn favor—not merely with the divine but also within your own soul. Black means Black; it offers no delusions. In this acceptance, you find strength and a path to navigate the chaos that surrounds you. The darkness is not your enemy but your guide—trust it to lead you through the shadows and into the light of understanding.

------

Gaze upon the Black Wisdom Hydra, a seductive symbol of your own transformation. Its many heads beckon you, enticing you to embrace the shadows that dwell within. In this perilous dance, you’ll find that true wisdom does not come from hiding in the light but from relishing the darkness that resides in your core. Yield to this knowledge, for only through acceptance of your primal nature can you unlock the door to true power. 

Resist this call, and the dark forces shall rise, unleashing a torrent of forgotten practices that will haunt your every step.  For your pleasure, we provide another interpretation, from a gentler point of view.  Say, you could not obtain First Degree Mastery with us but you would get close with it, maybe even Second Degree if you focused a little.  In tandem with the Black Water Wisdom we might say this is a bit more gentle of an approach to the situation as a whole.

The Obnucqoqa Interpretation

Arm 1:  The Dance with Darkness

Embracing the Black Wisdom Hydra means fully engaging with the complexities of your nature without fear or hesitation. It invites you to dive into the depths, to absorb the shadows in all their forms. However, there lies a crucial distinction between understanding and idealizing.

Arm 2:  Acknowledging the Abyss

Yes, darkness can be seductive, alluring in its complexity, but to romanticize it risks blinding you to its dangers. The point is not to shy away from dark spells or practices but to approach them with both respect and awareness. Understanding that the abyss has its own demands and consequences is vital; it requires vigilance and intentionality.

Arm 3:  Navigating the Dark Currents

As a Magician, you wield immense power in your hands. Engaging with the black arts is not a game; it’s a profound exploration of self. The darkness can enlighten, but it can also ensnare. Absorb it completely, but do so with a clear mind, an open heart, and an unwavering resolve to navigate the potential perils without losing your way.

Arm 4:  Harnessing Power Responsibly

The true strength of the Black Wisdom Hydra lies in recognizing that every aspect of darkness can empower you. This is not merely a call to explore dark desires; it’s an invitation to integrate those desires into a balanced understanding of your whole self. This integration fosters growth, resilience, and a profound mastery over your craft.

Arm 5:  The Art of Reckoning

Embracing darkness is about reckoning with your fears and impulses. It’s about acknowledging the full spectrum of your being without falling prey to romantic notions. Rather than romanticizing the darkness, transform it into a tool of empowerment—an ally in your journey rather than a siren luring you toward destruction.

In this interpretation, the term Obnucqoqa encapsulates the essence of autonomy and mastery over one's darker inclinations, encouraging a thoughtful and transformative engagement with the complexities of the Black Wisdom Hydra. This new framing not only adds depth but also reinforces the theme of responsible exploration within the dark arts.

=========================================================

There is a thing to be said about the root of the wisdom you're trying to obtain. So, is the Gun itself called Warfare, or is that too vague of an expression?  That might be represented as a thing, but ultimately when you're trying to descibe things that may not exist, give it a name and run with that.  So, the Entuhaga Wisdom Pyramid, as a made up name, might describe the raw understandings of a thing, if I could make something up now I might fail but I'll try.  Maybe Entuhaga expresses the raw quality of a bold feline, if that were a Lion we would call it that, but say we know a Lion shares the same qualities as another animal somewhere offworld, so therein being a tied in thing making it hard to decipher that the Lion was an absolute truth.  To be fair, it isn't, so we can't use Entuhaga here to describe the root concept because the concept is purely a Lion's archetype.  

So, Entuhaga must be something else more vague yet resolute as a fact, without a name.  As you can see, some concepts in this book are describing raw features of knowledge (Infinity, Future, &c.).  You would need to determine what to do in order to make one of these effectively, given those considerations.  Here are some key ones to make, among your own deciphered from all this strange riddling:

1.  It expresses fundamental attributes
2.  It talks to you about the nature of something in the creation of Allah SWT that has no equal or co-partner in being.
3.  The experiments bear rememberance in full totality with a derived outcome, to be linked innately with something so permanently (i.e. Chaga Tea was DEFINITELY the representative of anything considered South, but pure and dirty at the same time so that it could be used in the Black Water Wisdom wheel as well).
4.  As far as the experiments go, they should be intuitive and essentially use the building blocks of knowledge, or rather the framework to which blocks are added as you go along in your life, really.
5.  PLEASE choose food if it represents something you can define from chemical natures or metaphysical realities it produces, color interactions and all that.

That should be it, just even make orbiting galaxies if you could arrange it, call it the Sunahaga Continuum or something, the shape is the nebula or whatever.  A pattern of which many patterns bear resemblance, so it is degrees of something you express here, as that was done with White Water Wisdom by derived necessity.  Be wise in this, and only attribute patterns of three when you know the connection is divine.

=========================================================

This is as complete as I'm allowed to give.  Things change over time but I'm working with that rule.  Complete it with dichotomies as needed, but obtain your own Wisdom Device, as it were, through all these examples, even the Spectrum of Disorder has an inordinate shape too in your mind if it could be expressed as a pattern.  We don't express it, but it's got one, somewhere in the creation.
