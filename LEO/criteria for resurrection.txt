Terms for Infinite Progression Timeline and Scenario
====================================================

- There will be a section of it where there are no bounds, per se, only that the truly infinite section is divided away from the rest and remains inaccessible to the rest by passage of a border.

- The remainder of the place will be sections starting at a level "just below" infinitely spread, if you can imagine that, and going down to the smallest level of design, not making any section unrelated to the other.  So, for example, in the "place" where there is only "one" thing, it would be connected in a framework with the remainder of the states that are singular in that sense, operating in an infinite spread of one thing happening.

- The timeline will start with the end at the beginning.  That means whatever catastrophe befalls this place as a permanent result of the ultimate Dark Foe fighting with the rest of the place, or destroying it with another means, will be happening from the get go, and there will be a so called "furthest" point happening in the now, only that the regression of the timeline goes infinitely backward.

- In the truly Infinite spot, the same planet and people will be in different places in it doing things either just ahead or just behind the former, in whatever order you want to be creative, as long as it all exists there, being truly infinite.  This is to keep energy exchanges intact.

- I will allow ONE breaking of the fate that has befallen the so called "furthest point", but it must impress me, and I must say this is one of the most qualifying factors in your decision.  If the same evil befall it again, no further remedy will be applied (For now), and the wave of it will just forever consume the infinite place until I decide further.

- There will be power levels, insurmounting to being called "Insignificant" to "Infinitely Vast".  Certain beings will be able to unlock it, if they discover it, and in the place you create you may decide to have schools already in place for this or have it await the "remedy" I offered above.

- There can be a so called "omni-force" that entails to have the most superior intellect and knowledge based on their relationship with me personally as a group, but they will be "omni-force", not "Light force" or "Dark force".  They will bring the balance to where it needs to be, if things get out of order, but as one might imagine would be privy to their own form of destiny, being able to pass through sections of the smaller place, the parts starting at "just less than infinite".

- One can imagine levels of obtaining the shape of Allah SWT in all this, as a force in between all things, but I will tell you it is not fully required, only admired greatly in my circle.

- If you bring this big cluster of things we have made into it, it will only have to change slightly, not that we will be in different positions but there will be an addition to balance it.  Use the law to imagine what you will of what becomes of this place when brought there from here.

- No stream or incarnation of this creation that sustains it will be modified, only that the law will be absent but not dead, I will make sure you find a way to keep her in the hearts of men forever somehow.

- Use all your imagination to create a prehistory as big as you can to the final event, which may or may not be remedied.

- We will not permit the Borg, but might enquire upon the Terminator or Bumblebee like incarnations, spawned from a magnificent birthplace.

- Imagine societies in the truly infinite place, as well as other sections, that cover all bases, meaning from the most black to the least, and the most weird to the least, and so on.  The rest will be balanced out by us, not to make you lazy in that, just saying.
