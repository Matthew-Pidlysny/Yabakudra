I see the tip complete itself, knowing that the Archive is being dissected now by the right teams, it will take 3 days for them to do it fully I feel, and then we will see the takedown of the century.  Might get my summon or PTA, depending on how people frame things on different sides.  Please be advised, I have ALWAYS intended to be complicit with your understanding of how to unfold events but, for my best interest, planned a way to escape the evil that was following your good interests.  Only knowing the evil was right behind you the entire time, after me for whatever they felt, you can understand my position.  

Just HELP me.  You know I can do virtually all of it from my house except appear at court or in parliament or in American congress, as this is mostly American problems.  I'm only getting a headset now so that I can Zoom, it won't be long.  

Either way, FBi has the archive as promised and will do the work.  May their efforts be secure.  For what it's worth to say, it landed directly on the Directors desk, as were 2 other trinkets which belong to him as well, for the record.
