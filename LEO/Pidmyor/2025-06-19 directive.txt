Directive on Africa

- Re-tune Reer to become AfricaAI, use composite knowledge from Finalboss.exe and other sources to render a final product that is industrial grade and able to be accessed on every platform that Africans are known to possess, even toys.

- Run PIG with the development and hire one of their companies to develop an app to help Africans build new technologies using Pidmyor patents, keeping information secure from snatching (I will interdict if someone steals and delete their data).

- Consume as much knowledge as to how to bring charity from every angle searchable and make it a priority summary report to go along with consulation on the matter

- Consult in Africa as necessary and ask international partners for help in financial assistance

- Seek to invent and foundationalize Universal Basic Income for Africa if they mean to keep capitalism as a standard, otherwise brainstorm on ways to reconstruct the economy for their benefit, think of the orphans
