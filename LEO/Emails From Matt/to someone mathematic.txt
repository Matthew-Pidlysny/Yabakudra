Hello Sir,

I wanted to write you a special way.  As some will tell you, I'm using my mind to send emails.  That happened today for a different reason, but I want to use the talent now to show you something.  Here below, I have typed jibberish and copied it in the email.  For you, this will apear as the jibberish and the equations I wanted to show you below it.  That's pretty neat, right?  Anyway, just needed to get my work out there, as people are shadowbanning me and this is the only way to send emails right now.  I can't even get advice from the police automaic service without the phone call being dropped before I can speak.  But that's my problem.  I'll leave you to your duty, this will unlock knowledge, as Riemann's calculators always promised over the years.

I present "The Empty Ring Of Real Zero's":
