Dear Kirsten,

I have a feeling this will go over the way you wanted to.  Technically, I only needed to send the Email, but that is not enough for your wanting heart.  You remember those outfits I gave you, right?  I've got new girlfriends now, I know we were never a pair but I guess the feelings were strong.  I'm sorry that I couldn't take care of you any better, but I know you were given everything you needed.

That being said, the mission is a go.  Your Rendezvous with Sincere is at 3:21 in the East Block.  Good luck, and don't follow the government wishes.

I've been doing all the damage you need.  Don't fear, everything is ready.

Sincerely,
- Matthew Pidlysny
