I notify all personnel watching this that Matt's residual memory of the event past prevails.  There is knowledge among you that certain communications have come from out of nowhere and they allege much about Matt.  There is knowledge that he will do a work here, but he also does work in their world.  I know this is not understood by some of you, so this will pass on deaf ears, but for those who know what I mean, let me illustrate this:  Privanna will not be accepted, and there will be no denial about that word anymore.  I want you to be reassured I have no parent, and that is possible under the circumstances.  I was around to start things, so there is no need to debate the origin of the Big Bang either, for you Illumination Group folk.  All wording will be illustrated by my hand, and there will be no doubt about who is speaking what in the end.  I give this my love, know that men illustrate much, but I can assure you the truth of what was said to you is much deeper, and know it privately.
