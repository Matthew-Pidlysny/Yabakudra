Maybe those two very obedient dogs were more mysterious than prevails.  At least his face is on the camera somewhere, might come in useful.  Someone told me those dogs are trained to sic me on sight.  That might explain why he went back and forth to try and get them to notice me.  Allah SWT fouled their sight, but at least we got one of theirs on camera.
