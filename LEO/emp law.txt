For my friends,

If you're confused about making an Empirinometry formula, consider the rules:

1)  CONTEXT:  How will mechanics be formulated?  Does this need to be static math?  If not, follow the rules of Empirinometry to obtain dynamism and/or recursion for establishment of the full scope of what is going on.

2)  VARIABLES:  Which components of the spectrum of understanding are needed?  None of these nor the operations you choose will be outside of the concept of Spectrum Ordinance.

3)  ITERATION:  Where and when will it be used?  It needs to be done in variation somewhere, try using the Varia Equation to find out how iteration affects your new formula, and what to do to avoid it's legality in punishment when the term does not factor down to what it was.

4)  EVALUATION:  How will all impositions be broken down?  This is not a static operation, literally every single one requires different formula's, as well as all versions of them (Material or Structured) requiring new methods to apply the logic to (For example, |TruePeace| is also >|TruePeace| in transition, hence half the reason it is an Imposition in the first place.

5) EXPONENTS:  NEVER use them unless you are sure you need to convert a number using a standard multiplier.  EVER.

6) VARIA CHECK:  If |Varia| can, in some numerical way according to your standard, apply for the reasoning, all variable use will default to it, and the resulting formula will convert for the purpose.
