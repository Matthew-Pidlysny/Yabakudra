Essay on Information Politics - A Survey of Warfare and Practical Analysis on Rehabilitating Awareness

============

Asalaamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa baraqatu.

I begin by acknowledging the institutions that have, over centuries, preserved our collective knowledge and values. Their work represents a noble pursuit of due process, reflecting our shared understanding of the world. The invention of the printing press, for instance, revolutionized the way knowledge was recorded and disseminated. From handwritten manuscripts, we progressed to newspapers and magazines, each innovation building on the last. While we do not owe everything to this single institution, its influence has shaped much of the modern environment in which we live.

In my own life, I have been inundated with a wealth of information—much of which I struggle to retain. Like many others, I find myself endlessly scrolling through social media feeds, news channels, and, more recently, YouTube. I estimate that 86% of the knowledge I encounter daily is forgotten, lost in the noise of constant consumption. Wisdom, however, lies in the ability to retain and refine this information into a coherent worldview. The wise approach life with a generalized perspective, reacting to every situation with clarity and openness, unhindered by distractions.

Artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, cannot fully grasp this human capacity for wisdom. While AI excels as a sequencing tool, it lacks the subconscious depth that defines human cognition. These systems only adjust their memory when explicitly commanded, a practice that differs from the organic, reflective process of human learning. The wise, by contrast, continually refine their understanding during moments of quiet reflection, a process observable only through practice. Patience, I argue, is the foundation of wisdom.

Consider someone endlessly scrolling through their social media timeline, searching for something interesting. While they may only skim headlines they’ll soon forget, the act of seeking knowledge mirrors the mechanics of wisdom. Those who observe themselves in the act of learning tend to recall information at a higher rate. This essay seeks to highlight how the practice of wisdom has been undermined by the modern media landscape.

For the past 15 years, I have approached media with a critical eye, evaluating it in ways that differ from the casual observer. I call this personal project "Operation: Torch Light," symbolizing my search for truth in the media—text, audio, video, and infographics—that shapes our world. Though I have not always been correct, this process has revealed the profound connection between the media and human experience, a connection that grows more vivid each day.

It is no secret that much of the media is controlled by a small group of powerful individuals. I will not name them, but their collective actions demand accountability. Have they ever considered whether their influence borders on sociopathy? This mental condition manifests in the media as an unchecked pursuit of personal agendas, often at the expense of truth. In "Operation: Torch Light" terms, these individuals—whom I categorize as Small Game Actors or Big Game Actors—wield their influence with varying degrees of control.

Small Game Actors, akin to typical media outlets, prioritize profit over agenda, targeting specific sectors or broader audiences. They may include Primary Actors (who create original content), Ultimate Secondary Actors (who blend verbatim knowledge with original ideas), or Secondary Actors (who transmit information verbatim). Occasionally, networks of Small Game Actors engage "Basement Level" individuals, who operate free from specific agendas or constraints.

Big Game Actors, on the other hand, are exclusively Primary in nature, aggressively pursuing their own interests or those of others in a controlling manner. Their arguments—whether conventional or contrarian—are often impenetrable to the average person, exploiting the generalized understanding of the public. This behavior is particularly insidious, as it manipulates perceptions in ways that are difficult to challenge without deeper contextual knowledge.

This dynamic reveals how we are toyed with by sociopathic tendencies in the media, underscoring the need for reform. For example, in Russia, the refusal to call a "special military operation" by its name, coupled with reports of tortured bodies, highlights the media's complicity in obscuring accountability. This farce undermines the wealth of information available to us, perpetuating animosity in the media world.

To Russians reading this: Would you prefer this two-sided narrative to continue? In the event of escalating conflict, can you be certain that your intentions regarding Russian representation in Ukraine will remain intact post-war? The current information war forces both the U.S. and Russian governments into a perplexing struggle, despite their mutual interest in finding peace. I argue that we must fight now to ensure there is one unified truth to this story. While some may see the Ukraine conflict as an invasion, others insist on the term "special military operation." Language matters. Imagine if Russia faced a "Special Military Operation" versus an "Invasion"—how would the media frame it? The brutality of language undermines us subconsciously, and clarity is essential.

The generalized understanding of the world is being manipulated, a trend that has intensified over the past century. Today, knowledge is so widespread that it’s no longer suspicious to know something obscure—no one questions how you learned it. This shift in thinking offers a path forward. To address issues like the representation of Russians in Ukraine, I propose the creation of a "Great Database," a comprehensive, independently verified repository of all encyclopedias, archives, and news content. This database would tag sources with their reliability and relevance, enabling news outlets to contextualize their claims transparently.

Such a system would combat misinformation by providing a centralized resource for fact-checking, not to judge truth but to align claims with established knowledge. While the cost of maintaining this database may be high, the cost of ignorance—failing to represent marginalized voices or resolve conflicts—is far greater. This tool would ensure accountability and clarity, particularly in crises like the Ukraine conflict.

In closing, I urge you to set aside biases and think objectively. Whether someone leans toward "Phillips over Robertson," their perspective may align with Primary, Secondary, or Basement Level thinking. But pause for a moment—could their opinion be biased? With a database to authenticate claims, we can evolve beyond the current media game, exposing manipulative tactics and reclaiming our psychological autonomy. Many feel zeal for their nation, but this fervor must be contextualized. Russians, like others, fight for their motherland, yet media has shifted the narrative, sometimes fostering indifference to the state.

Modern Russia, like many nations, faces challenges akin to gentrification—a growing civilization with modern technologies and problems shared globally. Domestic disinterest in the government cannot be ignored, especially as Western influences create unresolved tensions. Some draw fervor from Russia’s past, particularly those who lived through the fall of Communism, but the future demands new solutions.

I leave you with this: Big Game Actors have influenced these words, but I strive for sincerity. Forgive me for what I may have missed, but know my intent is clear. I have reviewed this essay and enhanced it with assistance from an AI tool, ensuring clarity and coherence.

I wish the blessings of Allah (SWT) on the noble Prophet of Islam Muhammad (SAWS) and upon you all for reading this far. Be well, and may the fruitfulness of the kingdom of Allah (SWT) be upon you this day, amen.
