Maybe these criteria would be good for a compartment:

1.  Gaining intelligence from sources that depict the reaction to known video segments I have watched.  Things like critique of the moment, physical behaviours indicated, and other seemingly augmented processes they themselves convey about the situation would help.  This will break down into political things, you can ignore that if you want as I'm looking for physical but would render well to know all things that were "strange" to the people involved in the segment.  Not everyone will be involved, essentially you can keep it to main orators, but some others would be affected by rights.

2.  Any positioning data gained from Psychic ordinance measures would be indicative of a sort of "confirmation" that those things took place, if not describing the real situation.

That should do it, it's alot of stuff so break 'er down, you're in for a ride! :)
